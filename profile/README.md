## 🧩 What Is the Mod Menu in Phasmophobia?

The **mod menu** is an in-game interface that lets you activate and customize all kinds of cheats. It’s not just one hack – it’s a full cheat suite. Open it with a hotkey (usually `Insert`) and boom – you've got control over nearly every part of the game. ESP, sanity, evidence, ghost behavior, item spawns – all at your fingertips.

And yes… it even works online (but keep it chill if you don't wanna get flagged 😅)
